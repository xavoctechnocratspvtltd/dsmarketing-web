                                <div class="subtitle xepan-component xepan-no-move xepan-no-delete xepan-editable-text  mce-content-body mce-edit-focus" id="d540f501-82ea-4cae-bf13-44d9ec74602e" style="position: relative;" contenteditable="false"><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">The word Ayurveda comes from two root words in Sanskrit, Ayush meaning life or life span and Veda meaning knowledge. The science of Ayurveda, thus, literally means the complete knowledge of the totality and longevity of life. </span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">Ayurveda the ‘science of life’, or longevity, is the holistic alternative science from India, and is more than 5000 years old. It is believed to be the oldest healing science in existence, forming the foundation of all others. </span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">The re-awakening of Ayurveda reflects the resurgence of the traditional values of life governed by natural law and reverses the neglect of natural medicine that had taken place in recent centuries. Ayurveda was obliterated in ignominy and oblivion. Centuries old clinical and theoretical knowledge became lost and unavailable. Its effectiveness also became limited since practitioners did not use its comprehensive approaches. Since ages, sages and physicians have been rediscovering this timeless health wisdom and today, Ayurveda is practiced by more than 400,000 Ayurveda doctors, and is recognized by the WHO as an effective health science. </span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">Ayurveda Texts, scriptures &amp; oral traditions ascribe their authorship to Charka, Dhanvantari, Sushruta, Kashyap, Vagbhata, Sarangadhara Samhita &amp; others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">Ayurveda, said to be a world medicine, is the most holistic or comprehensive medical system available. Before the arrival of writing, the ancient wisdom of healing, prevention, and longevity was a part of the spiritual tradition of universal religion. Healers gathered from the world over, bringing their medical knowledge to India. Veda Vyasa, the famous sage, preserved the complete knowledge of Ayurveda in writing, along with the more spiritual insights of ethics, virtue, and self-Realization. "The knowledge of Ayurveda was handed down from Brahma to Daksha Prajapati, onto the Ashwin twins (the divine doctors), then passed to Indra. Sage Bharadvaja volunteered to go to heaven to received this wisdom from Indra, and so became the first human to receive the knowledge of Ayurveda. He passed it to Atreya, then onto Punarnavasu and finally Agnivesha"</span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">The methods used to find this knowledge of herbs; foods, aromas, gems, colors, yoga, mantras, lifestyle, and surgery are fascinating and varied. The sages, physicians/surgeons of the time were the same sages or seers, deeply devoted holy people, who saw health as an integral part of spiritual life. It is said that they received their training of Ayurveda through direct cognition during meditation. That is, the knowledge of the use of the various methods of healing, prevention, longevity, and surgery came through divine revelation; guessing or animal testing was un-necessary. These revelations were transcribed from oral tradition into written form, interspersed with aspects of mortal life and spirituality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">Passages related to Ayurveda from the various Vedas were combined into separate books dealing only with Ayurveda. Among the Rik Veda's 10,572 hymns are discussions of the three constitutions (doshas): Air (Vayu), Fire (Pitta) and Water (Kapha). Topics comprised organ transplants, artificial limbs, and the use of herbs to heal diseases of the mind and body and to foster longevity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">The purpose of Ayurveda is to tell us and help understand how our lives can be influenced, shaped, extended and managed according to changing seasons, biological age etc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">The entire health revolves around how one manages three physiological factors Vata Pitta and Kapha, before they became pathological.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;"> Vata-Pitta-Kapha constantly change according to season, age, how one eats, drinks etc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">One who is able to keep above in balance enjoys health. </span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">A verse from Sushruta Samhita</span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">According to Ayurveda, the Doshas Vata-Pitta-Kapha, when are perfectly balanced, Agni properly works (13 types of Agnis), wastes are properly excreted, all the senses are blissful, that is when it is called Perfect Health. </span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">Health is of utmost importance according to Ayurveda, every human or animal kingdom activity is governed by good health. </span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">Ayurveda tells us about every aspect of health, including Mental Health and experience of Bliss</span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">Balanced health rests upon various factors, including diet, sleep, celibacy, panchkarma, yoga and meditation, intake of rasayanas and spiritual healing, which includes chanting hymns, yagya etc. </span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">Diet plays a very important role, infact, Diet in itself is a ‘Medicine’. It determines the state of mind as well as of the body. </span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">As per Charaka, a learned person having control over senses should always eat healthy foods in moderate quantity in all seasons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">When diet is proper, they medicine is of no need. </span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">When diet is improper, then medicine is of no use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">Our physical and mental health is very much dependent on having a good night’s sleep. </span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">Improper sleep leads to many diseases, especially aggravates Vata. </span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">Patters of sleep also vary from person to person and season to season, depending upon their Prakrati or body type and the current condition of their physiology, e.g. sleeping during the daytime is alright during summers and afternoon sleep for a diabetic person is very unhealthy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">Panchkarma is also very important to balance doshas and prevent diseases. Once the disease has set in, even then Panchkarma is useful as it helps the body clean itself and get rid of toxins. </span></p><p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;">Ayurveda thus offers health through Diet and its rules, </span><span style="font-size: 14px;" data-mce-style="font-size: 14px;"><br>1. Sleep patterns, <br>2. Celibacy (Physically &amp; Mentally), <br>3. Regular Panchkarma (season or disease wise), <br>4. Exercise (Yoga or other exercises’) <br>5. Spiritual healing (chanting hymns, Yagyas, Balis etc.) <br>6. Rasayanas (health maintenance)</span></p></div>
